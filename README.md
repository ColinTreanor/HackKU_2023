# HackKU_2023
Hack KU event, team project made by Nicholas Holmes, Alex Doehring, Colin Treanor, and Raymann Singh.
We are all freshmen Computer Science students at Kansas University.

For this event we are trying to make a webpage that allows users to play the card game Crazy Eights. 

Game: Crazy Eights
 How to play:
  Crazy Eights is a card game where the goal is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in his hand. The game can be played with a standard playing card deck for 2 to 5 players. If there are two players, deal 7 cards each. If there are more, deal 5 cards each. The remaining cards go in a stack face down in the middle. Turn the top card over. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by placing a matching card on the discard pile. The game continues clockwise, and each player must play a card that matches the current card in either suit or rank. If no card is matching, draw up to three cards from the draw pile. The player who is the first to have no cards left wins the game. The winning player collects points from each other player based on the value of the cards remaining in their hands.
