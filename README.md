# HackKU_2023
Hack KU event, team project made by Nick, Alex, Colin, and Raymann.
We are all freshmen Computer Science students at Kansas University.

For this event we are trying to make an app that allows users to play different card games.

First Game: King's Corners
 How to play:
  The goal of this game is to be the first player to run out of cards. Turns will go around the table clockwise, and a player must pick up one card from the pile at the beginning of their turn. If a player draws a King, a new pile must be created with the King in one of four corners and the same player will draw again. 
  Cards can only be played onto a card of the same suit in descending order(e.g. 8 of spades can only be played on a 9 of spades). If their is an instance of two piles of the same suit with one card being the direct card down, said pile may be moved onto the pile with the direct higher card. In this case a blank pile is created allowing the player to place any card from their hand to fill this blank pile. Subsequently, this also works to stack onto the King piles in the corners. This theoretically makes it possible for a player to go out in one turn.
 
 Rules:
    1) Each player will start with 5 cards.
    2) Players must draw one card from the pile at the beginning of their turn.
    3) Players must play any card playable card within their hand, thus they cannot hold onto cards.
    4) Have fun!
