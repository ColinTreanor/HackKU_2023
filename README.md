# HackKU_2023
Hack KU event, team project made by Nicholas Holmes, Alex Doehring, Colin Treanor, and Raymann Singh.
We are all freshmen Engineering Students -- *three Computer Science students, One Aerospace* -- at Kansas University.

For this event we are trying to make a user playable version of the Crazy Eights card game using the pygame extension.

### <align center> *_How to play:_* ###
  Crazy Eights is a card game where the goal is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in his hand. The game can be played with a standard playing card deck for 2 to 5 players. If there are two players, deal 7 cards each. If there are more, deal 5 cards each. The remaining cards go in a stack face down in the middle. Turn the top card over. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by placing a matching card on the discard pile. The game continues clockwise, and each player must play a card that matches the current card in either suit or rank. If no card is matching, draw up to three cards from the draw pile. The player who is the first to have no cards left wins the game. The winning player collects points from each other player based on the value of the cards remaining in their hands.

  ## _Tools Used_ 
  This program requires the usage of a python extension called  `pygame` 
  
  1. Pygame is a popular extension module for the Python programming language that allows developers to create interactive games and multimedia applications. It provides a powerful set of tools and libraries for creating and manipulating graphics, sound, and input events.

  2. Pygame is built on top of the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library, which provides low-level access to computer hardware, such as graphics cards and sound cards. This means that Pygame can be used to create high-performance applications that utilize hardware acceleration for smooth graphics and fast sound processing.

  3. Pygame provides a number of useful features, such as sprites, collision detection, event handling, and sound effects, which make it easy to create complex games and applications.

  4. It also supports a wide range of file formats for images, sounds, and fonts, making it easy to import and use existing assets in your game or application. Additionally, Pygame provides support for various input devices, such as keyboards, mice, and joysticks, which makes it easy to create interactive applications that respond to user input.
